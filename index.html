            <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>I’m a full stack developer with a background in science, statistics, and operations management.  
                Credentials include a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Utah, a 
                master’s degree in science from Texas A&M University--Corpus Christi, and a Lean Six Sigma Master 
                Black Belt.  My unique combination of education and work experience has given me an excellent 
                combination of highly-desired technical skills – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases – and valuable
                 soft-skills in leadership, prioritization, critical thinking, and interpersonal relations.  
                 Currently, I build and maintain small business websites, SEO, and social marketing campaigns
                  in addition to training professionals on all organizational levels in product development, 
                  process engineering, project management, quality assurance, and leadership.  In the future, 
                  I look forward to using Data analytics, QA testing and debugging, and UI/UX design with a Lean
                   flavor to develop products that help organizations and individuals operate efficiently.</p>
                   
                <br>

                <p>For over 15 years, I was a quality control/quality assurance and R&D professional in 
                    manufacturing, warehouse, and laboratory operations. I’ve been on a management level for 
                    the past 6 years. As a Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt, I’ve also done project consulting
                     and professional training in project management, operational excellence, statistical 
                     analysis, experimental design, and quality management. I’ve worked with a variety of 
                     quality management schemes such as ISO, HACCP, BAP, GlobalGAP, AWS (American Welding
                      Society), IDFB, and AZA. Additionally, I’ve been responsible for compliance with local,
                       state, federal, and international governmental regulations. Not only have I been a
                        department manager with direct reports, but I’ve also been a project manager for several
                         local and global cross-functional projects, many projects spanning multiple countries.
                          Projects have involved big data analysis for production improvement, designing and
                           implementing quality management systems, engineering operational processes and 
                           quality testing methods, developing new products, conducting root cause analyses 
                           and implementing corrective action, and conducting scientific experiments and research.
                            I’ve led or participated in projects involving Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
                             Chile, China, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Holland, Norway, Turkey, USA, Vietnam, and Zambia.</p>
